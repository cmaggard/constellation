  <h1>Application Error - Exceptional Circumstance</h1>
  <p><em>
      I must not fear.  Fear is the mind-killer.<br />
      Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.<br />
      I will face my fear.  I will permit it to pass over me and through me.<br />
      And when it is gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.<br />
      Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.<br />
      Only I will remain.<br />
